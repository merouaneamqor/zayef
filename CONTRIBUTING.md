## Code of Conduct

This project follows a code of conduct to ensure a welcoming environment for all contributors. By participating, you agree to:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Accept responsibility for mistakes
- Show empathy towards other contributors
- Help create a positive community

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.7+ (check version with `ruby -v`)
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)
- Git

### Quick Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zayef.git
   cd zayef
   ```
3. Set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   bin/setup
   ```
4. Verify everything works:
   ```bash
   bundle exec ruby demo.rb
   ```

## Development Setup

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

### Available Development Tasks

Zayef uses Rake for development tasks. Run `rake -T` to see all available tasks:

```bash
# Run all quality checks (tests, docs, etc.)
rake

# Run tests
rake dev:test

# Generate documentation
rake dev:docs

# Check code quality
rake dev:quality

# Generate changelog
rake changelog:full

# Check if git-cliff is available
rake changelog:check

# Create conventional commit interactively
rake git:commit
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Check existing [issues](https://github.com/amqor/zayef/issues) on GitHub
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write tests first (TDD approach)
- Follow the existing code style
- Add documentation for new features
- Ensure all tests pass

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the full test suite
rake dev:test

# Run specific tests
bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/test.rb

# Run the demo to verify functionality
bundle exec ruby demo.rb
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test file
bundle exec rspec spec/zayef/generator_spec.rb

# Run with coverage
bundle exec rspec --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Place test files in `spec/` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both positive and negative scenarios
- Include edge cases

Example test structure:
```ruby
RSpec.describe Zayef::Generator do
  describe '#first_name' do
    it 'returns a Moroccan first name' do
      name = Zayef.first_name
      expect(Zayef::Generator::MOROCCAN_FIRST_NAMES).to include(name)
    end
  end
end
```

## Code Style

### Ruby Style Guidelines

- Follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Keep lines under 80 characters when possible
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Commit Messages

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
# Features
git commit -m "feat: add support for traditional Moroccan dishes"

# Bug fixes
git commit -m "fix: correct CNI number format validation"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update README with new usage examples"

# Breaking changes

### Code Organization

- Use private methods for internal logic
- Group related functionality in modules/classes
- Add YARD documentation comments
